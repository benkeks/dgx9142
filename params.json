PREFACE: TEN YEARS ####################\r\n\r\nIt's been more than ten years since I started working at DGX9142 on\r\n25 March 2004. Actually, I planned to make a little game over the\r\nEaster break of 2004. I was 15 years old at that time.\r\n\r\nSince then, lots of stuff has happened, but the completion of DGX9142 is\r\nnot among it. Battlefied 1942, which inspired this game, has become some\r\nkind of a classic. DirectX 7, which is used for the graphics, has long\r\nreached the end of its life cycle. I and all the other people who have\r\ncontributed to DGX9142 do quite different things by now. For my part,\r\nI am more into theoretical computer science, print design and political\r\nstuff today.\r\n\r\nOver the last six years, DGX9142 has hardly been developed any further.\r\nThe last public alpha was released in March 2008. So I and Steff decided\r\nto abandon the project. We don't want it to rot on our hard drives.\r\nThus we release it. This final release is ; in a way the most unfinished\r\nversion of DGX9142 that has ever been published: Some textures are\r\nmissing, the net code most likely won't work properly, there is no real\r\nbalancing etc. etc.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game anyway. :)\r\n   -- 25 December 2015, Benjamin Bisping (aka Mr.Keks)\r\n\r\n## 1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nMinimum | Needed\r\n------- | --------------------\r\nCPU     |  1 GHz\r\nRAM     |  1 GB\r\nDisk    |  100 MB\r\nGPU     |  128 MB GPU Memory, DirektX 7 Support\r\n\r\nOn newer Windows versions there might be problems with DX7-games. I only tested the game with Wine on Ubuntu, where it works fine.\r\n\r\n## 2. MANUAL: HOW TO PLAY\r\n\r\nThe basic gameplay follows the Battlefield principle.\r\n\r\nEvery team has a certain number of *tickets*. Killing enemy ships or holding special positions decreases\r\nthe enemy team's ticket counter. A team wins if the other team's counter hits zero.\r\n\r\nYour ships spawn at *jump gates* held by your team.\r\nYou can conquer further jump gates by flying close to them while there is no enemy ship around. Some gates cannot be conquered -- they are marked with a restriction symbol.\r\nJump gates with a green arrow next to their name spawn NPC cruisers.\r\n\r\nBefore joining the battle at a jump gate, you chose out of four *ship classes*.\r\n\r\n* *Fighter* for ordinary combat.\r\n* *Bomber* to takle big cruisers and stations.\r\n* *Scout* for quick strikes at unexpected positions. (Scouts jam the enemy radar to a certain degree, but also counter enemy jamming.)\r\n* *Support* which regenerate friendly ships or supply them with new ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe *fighting* is quite similar to FreeSpace, Freelancer and other space games.\r\n\r\n* `WASD`: regulate the forward/backward/sideward thrust.\r\n* `Q` and `E`: roll.\r\n* `Tab`: enable the after burner\r\n* Middle mouse button: lock targets (highlighted by a rectangle)\r\n* Left/right mouse button: fire at the targeted ship\r\n\r\nFor *overview purposes* there are additional controls:\r\n\r\n* `M`: show overview map (your ship is highlighted with white)\r\n* `,`: toggle grid and hud info\r\n* `C`: pan view without rotating the ship\r\n* `Space`: zoom in\r\n\r\nIf you are your teams *commander* (as the only human player in a team you will be), you can use the overview map to give commands to your team:\r\n\r\n* `Left mouse button`: select ships\r\n* `Right mouse button`: give command (move to or attack)\r\n* `X`: Cancel command\r\n\r\n`Enter` activates the chat. You can also control parts of the game from there, the commands are explained if you enter `\\help`.\r\n\r\n`F1` shows a list of the active players and their score.\r\n\r\nHave fun playing!\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. REDISTRIBUTION?\r\n\r\nThe game is freeware. You may spread it as you whish.\r\n\r\nWe also include the source with the game. It's not really \"open source\"\r\nas the source is not \"open\" in the sense of: Easy to maintain by others.\r\n(No documentation, poor structure, some lazy hacks, redundancies, out-dated\r\nprograming language etc.) Still: Feel free to use the source in any way you\r\nlike, be it in other projects or in a more polished version of DGX.\r\n\r\nTo build the source, you will need Blitz3d. It can be obtained from\r\n<http://blitzbasic.com> for free. Its source code can also be found on\r\n[GitHub](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d).\r\n\r\nIf you continue DGX and publish your work, please include the original credits\r\nwith it. The third party parts within DGX are marked as such by comments.\r\nThe artwork is by the credited people or from freeware archives. You may use\r\nit in derived versions of DGX. If you want to use it in another context,\r\nyou may have to ask the very authors for permission.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
